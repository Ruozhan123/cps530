        <h3>About Jedi</h2>
        <p>Jedi is actually a black English labrador. He has been trained to alert his master Luke about his blood sugar when Jedi was just a puppy.</p>
        <p>Most Labradors are friendly and good nature dogs, who are usually as companions and as service dogs. <a href="https://www.thelabradorsite.com/labrador-characteristics/" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
        <h3>About Luke</h2>
        <p>Luke has been battling type 1 diabetes which is an autoimmune disease with no cure ever since he was diagnosed at 2 years old.</p>
        <h3>How Jedi Saves Luke?</h2>
        <p>The glucose in Luke's blood can quickly spike or plummet because his pancreas cannot produce insulin. If Luke's blood sugar gets too low, he starts to lose feeling in his hands and feet, gets dizzy, has pains in his stomach and is at risk of seizure, Dorrie, Luke's mother said. And if his blood sugar spikes too high, it can cause damage to his vital organs</p>
        <p>Jedi the dog can smell these spikes and dips. He brings over a brinsel which is a cloth tube to Dorrie and "bows" when Luke's blood sugar is too low and "waves" if it's too high.(Jedi lifts his paw up or down to signal the change).</p>
