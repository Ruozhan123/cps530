  <br><br>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What are the challenges encountered?</strong></li>
    <br>
    Part A: The biggest challenge is to add one more media query for tablet, especially for mobile which is smaller than 480px.
    <br>
    Part B: The biggest challenge is to understand bootstrap framework, and learn how to construct layout using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system.
  </ul>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Which one is easier, took less time and basically which one is preferred best?</strong></li>
    <br>
    I think Bootstrap framework is easier and took less time. Honest, I would prefer Bootstrap.
